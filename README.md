# reform-US-high-school-science-order
High school science in the United States is currently taught in the order biology, chemistry, physics for historical reasons. But actually today it makes more sense to teach it in the order physics, chemistry, biology.

TODOs:
- collect statistics on how many high schools in the US teach this way
- collect various opinions on this topic
